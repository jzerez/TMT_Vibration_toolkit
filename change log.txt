    -Cummulative data tab
        -populates information about current channels
        -displays number of tests, samples, and channels
        -Need to do:
            -populates informatoin about current test configurations (ex: test engineer, setup)
            -Figure out how to average data accross tests to plot
    -Adding/Loading Channels
        -Debugged series of problems Loading Config from file
        -Debugged removing channel functionality
    -Loading Data
        -Integrated plotting for loading data
        -Need to do: 
            - Figure out how this tool should interact with exsisting datasets. Just a plotter? 
    -Plotting
        -Tighter windows for the impulse waveform
        -Reasonable Impuls spectrum shown from sample data
        -Frequency Plots
        -PSD
            -Accelerometers from the sample data look a bit weird...
        -Coherance
        -Need to do:
            -Figure out coherance windowing parameters (big differences depending on windowing)
    -General
        -Check for non-zero collection time and non-zero system mass

7/16/19
- Low progress because of Akamai meeting
- Cummulative Data Tab
    -Configuration text box now gets populated with data
    -Added option to clear cummulative data

7/17/19
-Started testing with impact hammer. B&K 8207
    -0.225 V/N
    -Brown, Green, Red, Black tips (softest to hardest)
- Debugged time sync issues
    -reject duplicate packets from NI-DAQ
- Added multi-hit detection
- Possibility:
    - Make trigger only look for information from the hammer channel
-Added new default config
-Outstanding work;
    -how to average impacts
    -windowing for coherance?
    -frequency response?

Notes from meeting from peter:
    - averaging Coherance
        - check response from peter
        - check for matlab build in functionality
    -aboe the frequency of the rigid body mode, below the frequency of the bending modes. Should be a flat line (1/m). CAlled the mass line within the frequency response graph
    - for high frequency measurement, multiple acceleromters are used
    - Measure the damping ratio of the MSIT structure
    - Measure the transfer function of the MSIT structure
    - 
    hammer tests
        - signal decays, therefore there is high signal to noise ratio
        - faster than modal exciters
        - less control over what modes are being excited (you could be exciting local modes and not rigid body modes)
    modal accelerators
        - lot more "response engergy" higher signal to noise ratio
        -how to choose the rate of change of a linear chirp? avoid having excessive noise in a linear chirp
        -linear chirps are used commonly for resonant searches. Not used to stress the system or simulate an input, just used for characterizing (low amplitude inputs)
-Better windowing for impulse graph
-created solidworks file that denotes the location of MSIT mounts
-To dos:
    - change impulse spectrum to PSD
    - Change frequency response to PSD impulse/ PSD response
    - Average PSDs and plot in cumm data tab
    - Saving functionalities

7/19/19
-Added a few GUI alerts for missing channels/missing DAQ
-Changed spectrum graphs to PSDs
-Changed frequency response graph to A/F = 1/m
-Tried to separate coherance graph into Pxx, Pxy, Pyy. Failed.
    -Coherance is always 1. Similar to results from mscohere wtih excessive windowing
        -7/22/19 note on the previous bullet point: It was actually ~no~ windowing that was resulting in coherance = 1 for all freqs. This misscommunication is due to me misunderstanding how the windowing parameter is interepreted by Matlab
    -Why is this the case? pretty sure the math is right...
-Pretty freaking slow oh my gosh

7/22/19
-Got coherance working
    - It was always one because I was using periodograms to calculate it 
        -(abs(fft(cross-correlation)).^2 / fft(auto-corr) * fft(auto-corr))
            -Why this doesn't work: we only can estimate the PSD, and using this estimate results in 1/1 every time, no matter what x and y are
        -you need to split the data into segments and average the segments, this reduces varience overall
        -used MATLAB's mscohere function, be sure to set the windowing parameter such that there is more than one segement
-Got averaging between consecutive tests to work
    -Averages magnitude data for PSD, Frequency Response, Coherance
-Added more UI alerts/confirms/functions
    -acquisition settings get locked after adding to cummulative data
        -user gets prompted before this happens
    -Add new plot for impact PSD in cummulative page
    -Add save button for figures
    
-Need to do:
    -Add UI elements to control what gets plotted in coherance plot
    -Cohesive saving functionality
    -Add damping estimation functionality

7/23/19:
-Performed tests with speaker suspended from a chord
    -Compared actual inverse mass to estiamted inverse mass from the frequency response graph generated by the tool
        -4.44 1/km actual vs 0.7 1/km measured
-Added ability to save data in .figs
-Added damping estimation
-Filled out testing proposal form and submitted to Bob by the end of the day

7/24/19:
-Added data saving
-Added plotting for loaded data
-Added more UI locking features once data is added to the cummulative store
-Added labview mode for peter :)

7/25/19:
-Added channel selection for coherance plot generation
